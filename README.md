# An Introduction to Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits

This project serves as a simple introduction to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) and 
[Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/).

After introducing the concepts, it also demonstrates how to automate 
the creation of releases and automatically bumping your project 
version in the `package.json` file.
